The crypto Kingdoms' greed and self-inflations' brought the Winter upon them all, and with the winter, comes the big bad Bears of Winter.

The Shibes devised a plan, a plan to allow the native inhabitants to weather the Winter Bears storm.  When they maneuvered from crypto Kingdom to crypto Kingdom, they were able to build a discreet building in the Ethereum Kingdom where they could hide and lay in wait while their offspring came to fighting age.
            They called this base, the DeLot Here they allowed a native inhabitant to hide as they nurtured the young shibe offspring. Each shibes native inhabitant could use the building and gather resources. They continued to Doing Only Good Everyday and enriching the native inhabitants. The next step would be Phase 2.  "/>
